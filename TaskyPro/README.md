Tasky Pro
=========

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items. It illustrates proper application architecture
layering and uses a common code base for the Business Layer, Data Access
Layer, and Data Layer layers. It then separates out the User
Interface and Application Layer into the appropriate device-applications.

The application runs on iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7 with a set of 
common classes shared across all three platforms. Open the `TaskyMD_Mac.sln`
solution to see the iOS and Android apps on Mac OS-X and use the 
`TaskyVS.sln` with Visual Studio to see the Android and Windows Phone 7 apps.

The `features` folder of this example contains the Calabash tests for the Android and iOS versions of this application. Calabash is a automated UI acceptance testing framework. Please see [Xamarin's Calabash documentation](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/) for more information about Calabash.
